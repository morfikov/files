####################################################################################################

# If enabled, vsftpd will run in standalone mode. This means that vsftpd must not be run from an
# inetd of some kind. Instead, the vsftpd executable is run once directly. vsftpd itself will then
# take care of listening for and handling incoming connections. Default: YES
listen=yes
listen_address=192.168.1.150

# This directive enables listening on IPv6 sockets. By default, listening on the IPv6 "any" address
# (::) will accept connections from both IPv6 and IPv4 clients. It is not necessary to listen on
# *both* IPv4 and IPv6 sockets. If you want that (perhaps because you want to listen on specific
# addresses) then you must run two copies of vsftpd with two configuration files. This parameter
# and the listen parameter are mutually exclusive. Default: NO
listen_ipv6=no
#listen_address6=

# If vsftpd is in standalone mode, this is the port it will listen on for incoming FTP connections.
# Default: 21
listen_port=21
#listen_port=990

# When enabled, and vsftpd is started in "listen" mode, vsftpd will background the listener
# process. i.e. control will immediately be returned to the shell which launched vsftpd. Default: NO
background=NO

# Set to NO if you want to disallow the PORT method of obtaining a data connection. Default: YES
port_enable=NO

# This controls whether PORT style data connections use port 20 (ftp-data) on the server machine.
# For security reasons, some clients may insist that this is the case. Conversely, disabling this
# option enables vsftpd to run with slightly less privilege. Default: NO
connect_from_port_20=NO

# The port from which PORT style connections originate (as long as the poorly named
# connect_from_port_20 is enabled). Default: 20
ftp_data_port=20

# Set to YES if you want to disable the PORT security check that ensures that outgoing data
# connections can only connect to the client. Only enable if you know what you are doing!
# Default: NO
port_promiscuous=NO

# Set to NO if you want to disallow the PASV method of obtaining a data connection. Default: YES
pasv_enable=YES

# The minimum port to allocate for PASV style data connections. Can be used to specify a narrow
# port range to assist firewalling. Default: 0 (use any port)
pasv_min_port=50000

# The maximum port to allocate for PASV style data connections. Can be used to specify a narrow
# port range to assist firewalling. Default: 0 (use any port)
pasv_max_port=59999

# Set to YES if you want to disable the PASV security check that ensures the data connection
# originates from the same IP address as the control connection. Only enable if you know what you
# are doing! The only legitimate use for this is in some form of secure tunnelling scheme, or
# perhaps to facilitate FXP support. Default: NO
pasv_promiscuous=NO

# Use this option to override the IP address that vsftpd will advertise in response to the PASV
# command. Provide a numeric IP address, unless pasv_addr_resolve is enabled, in which case you can
# provide a hostname which will be DNS resolved for you at startup. Default: (none - the address is
# taken from the incoming connected socket)
# Default: NO
pasv_addr_resolve=NO
#pasv_address=

# Set to YES if you want vsftpd to run as the user which launched vsftpd. This is useful where root
# access is not available. MASSIVE WARNING! Do NOT enable this option unless you totally know what
# you are doing, as naive use of this option can create massive security problems. Specifically,
# vsftpd does not / cannot use chroot technology to restrict file access when this option is set
# (even if launched by root). A poor substitute could be to use a deny_file setting such as
# {/*,*..*}, but the reliability of this cannot compare to chroot, and should not be relied on. If
# using this option, many restrictions on other options apply. For example, options requiring
# privilege such as non-anonymous logins, upload ownership changing, connecting from port 20 and
# listen ports less than 1024 are not expected to work. Other options may be impacted. Default: NO
run_as_launching_user=NO

# This is the name of the user that is used by vsftpd when it wants to be totally unprivileged.
# Note that this should be a dedicated user, rather than "nobody". The user "nobody" tends to be
# used for rather a lot of important things on most machines. Default: nobody
nopriv_user=ftp

# This controls whether any FTP commands which change the filesystem are allowed or not. These
# commands are: STOR, DELE, RNFR, RNTO, MKD, RMD, APPE and SITE. Default: NO
write_enable=NO

# If set to NO, all download requests will give permission denied. Default: YES
download_enable=YES

# By default the server will pretend to allow ASCII mode but in fact ignore the request. Turn on
# the below options to have the server actually do ASCII mangling on files when in ASCII mode.
# Beware that on some FTP servers, ASCII support allows a denial of service attack (DoS) via the
# command "SIZE /big/file" in ASCII mode. vsftpd predicted this attack and has always been safe,
# reporting the size of the raw file. ASCII mangling is a horrible feature of the protocol.
# Default: NO
ascii_upload_enable=NO
ascii_download_enable=NO

# This string option allows you to override the greeting banner displayed by vsftpd when a
# connection first comes in. Default: (none - default vsftpd banner is displayed).
#ftpd_banner=Welcome to Morfikownia.
banner_file=/etc/vsftpd/banner

# If enabled, users of the FTP server can be shown messages when they first enter a new directory.
# By default, a directory is scanned for the file .message , but that may be overridden with the
# configuration setting message_file. Default: NO
dirmessage_enable=NO
message_file=.message

# If enabled, vsftpd will display directory listings with the time in your local time zone. The
# default is to display GMT. The times returned by the MDTM FTP command are also affected by this
# option. Default: NO
use_localtime=YES

# When enabled, a special FTP command known as "async ABOR" will be enabled. Only ill advised FTP
# clients will use this feature. Additionally, this feature is awkward to handle, so it is disabled
# by default. Unfortunately, some FTP clients will hang when cancelling a transfer unless this
# feature is available, so you may wish to enable it. Default: NO
async_abor_enable=NO

# If you have a Linux 2.4 kernel, it is possible to use a different security model which only uses
# one process per connection. It is a less pure security model, but gains you performance. You
# really don't want to enable this unless you know what you are doing, and your site supports huge
# numbers of simultaneously connected users. Default: NO
one_process_model=NO

# You probably don't want to change this, but try setting it to something like 8192 for a much
# smoother bandwidth limiter. Default: 0 (let vsftpd pick a sensible setting)
trans_chunk_size=0

# If enabled, vsftpd will try and show session status information in the system process listing. In
# other words, the reported name of the process will change to reflect what a vsftpd session is
# doing (idle, downloading etc). You probably want to leave this off for security purposes.
# Default: NO
setproctitle_enable=NO

# If enabled, and vsftpd was compiled with tcp_wrappers support, incoming connections will be fed
# through tcp_wrappers access control. Furthermore, there is a mechanism for per-IP based
# configuration. If tcp_wrappers sets the VSFTPD_LOAD_CONF environment variable, then the vsftpd
# session will try and load the vsftpd configuration file specified in this variable. Default: NO
tcp_wrappers=NO

# This options specifies a comma separated list of allowed FTP commands (post login. USER, PASS and
# QUIT and others are always allowed pre-login). Other commands are rejected. This is a powerful
# method of really locking down an FTP server. Example: cmds_allowed=PASV,RETR,QUIT .
# Default: (none)
#cmds_allowed=

# This options specifies a comma separated list of denied FTP commands (post login. USER, PASS,
# QUIT and others are always allowed pre-login). If a command appears on both this and cmds_allowed
# then the denial takes precedence. (Added in v2.1.0). Default: (none)
#cmds_denied=

# The timeout, in seconds, which is the maximum time a remote client may spend between FTP commands.
# If the timeout triggers, the remote client is kicked off. Default: 300
idle_session_timeout=300

# The timeout, in seconds, which is roughly the maximum time we permit data transfers to stall for
# with no progress. If the timeout triggers, the remote client is kicked off. Default: 300
data_connection_timeout=60

# The timeout, in seconds, for a remote client to establish connection with a PASV style data
# connection. Default: 60
accept_timeout=60

# The timeout, in seconds, for a remote client to respond to our PORT style data connection.
# Default: 60
connect_timeout=60

# This string is the name of the PAM service vsftpd will use. Default: ftp
pam_service_name=vsftpd

# This controls whether vsftpd attempts to maintain sessions for logins. If vsftpd is maintaining
# sessions, it will try and update utmp and wtmp. It will also open a pam_session if using PAM to
# authenticate, and only close this upon logout. You may wish to disable this if you do not need
# session logging, and you wish to give vsftpd more opportunity to run with less processes and / or
# less privilege. NOTE - utmp and wtmp support is only provided with PAM enabled builds. Default: NO
session_support=NO

# If enabled, use CLONE_NEWNET to isolate the untrusted processes so that they can't do arbitrary
# connect() and instead have to ask the privileged process for sockets ( port_promiscuous have to
# be disabled). Default: YES
isolate_network=YES

# If enabled, use CLONE_NEWPID and CLONE_NEWIPC to isolate processes to their ipc and pid
# namespaces. So separated processes can not interact with each other. Default: YES
isolate=YES

# Uncomment this to indicate that vsftpd use a utf8 filesystem.
utf8_filesystem=YES

# This option can be used to set a pattern for filenames (and directory names etc.) which should
# not be accessible in any way. The affected items are not hidden, but any attempt to do anything
# to them (download, change into directory, affect something within directory etc.) will be denied.
# This option is very simple, and should not be used for serious access control - the filesystem's
# permissions should be used in preference. However, this option may be useful in certain virtual
# user setups. In particular aware that if a filename is accessible by a variety of names (perhaps
# due to symbolic links or hard links), then care must be taken to deny access to all the names.
# Access will be denied to items if their name contains the string given by hide_file, or if they
# match the regular expression specified by hide_file. Note that vsftpd's regular expression
# matching code is a simple implementation which is a subset of full regular expression
# functionality. Because of this, you will need to carefully and exhaustively test any application
# of this option. And you are recommended to use filesystem permissions for any important security
# policies due to their greater reliability. Supported regex syntax is any number of *, ? and
# unnested {,} operators. Regex matching is only supported on the last component of a path,
# e.g. a/b/? is supported but a/?/c is not. Example: deny_file={*.mp3,*.mov,.private} .
# Default: (none)
deny_file={.message}

# This option can be used to set a pattern for filenames (and directory names etc.) which should be
# hidden from directory listings. Despite being hidden, the files / directories etc. are fully
# accessible to clients who know what names to actually use. Items will be hidden if their names
# contain the string given by hide_file, or if they match the regular expression specified by
# hide_file. Note that vsftpd's regular expression matching code is a simple implementation which
# is a subset of full regular expression functionality. See deny_file for details of exactly what
# regex syntax is supported. Example: hide_file={*.mp3,.hidden,hide*,h?} . Default: (none)
hide_file={.message}

# If set to NO, all directory list commands will give permission denied. Default: YES
dirlist_enable=YES

# If enabled, all user and group information in directory listings will be displayed as "ftp".
# Default: NO
hide_ids=NO

# If activated, files and directories starting with . will be shown in directory listings even if
# the "a" flag was not used by the client. This override excludes the "." and ".." entries.
# Default: NO
force_dot_files=YES

# The permissions with which uploaded files are created. Umasks are applied on top of this value.
# You may wish to change to 0777 if you want uploaded files to be executable. Default: 0666
file_open_mode=0666

# You may activate the "-R" option to the builtin ls. This is disabled by default to avoid remote
# users being able to cause excessive I/O on large sites. However, some broken FTP clients such as
# "ncftp" and "mirror" assume the presence of the "-R" option, so there is a strong case for
# enabling it. Default: NO
ls_recurse_enable=NO

# When enabled, this setting will allow MDTM to set file modification times (subject to the usual
# access checks). Default: YES
mdtm_write=YES

# If true, any failed upload files are deleted. (Added in v2.0.7). Default: NO
delete_failed_uploads=YES

# When enabled, all uploads proceed with a write lock on the upload file. All downloads proceed
# with a shared read lock on the download file. WARNING! Before enabling this, be aware that

# userlist_deny. Default: NO
userlist_enable=YES
userlist_file=/etc/vsftpd/userlist

# This option is examined if userlist_enable is activated. If you set this setting to NO, then
# users will be denied login unless they are explicitly listed in the file specified by
# userlist_file. When login is denied, the denial is issued before the user is asked for a password.
# Default: YES
userlist_deny=YES

# This powerful option allows the override of any config option specified in the manual page, on a
# per-user basis. Usage is simple, and is best illustrated with an example. If you set
# user_config_dir to be /etc/vsftpd_user_conf/ and then log on as the user "chris", then vsftpd
# will apply the settings in the file /etc/vsftpd_user_conf/chris for the duration of the session.
# The format of this file is as detailed in this manual page! PLEASE NOTE that not all settings are
# effective on a per-user basis. For example, many settings only prior to the user's session being
# started. Examples of settings which will not affect any behviour on a per-user basis include
# listen_address, banner_file, max_per_ip, max_clients, xferlog_file, etc. Default: (none)
user_config_dir=/etc/vsftpd/users/

# This option is useful is conjunction with virtual users. It is used to automatically generate a
# home directory for each virtual user, based on a template. For example, if the home directory of
# the real user specified via guest_username is /home/virtual/$USER, and user_sub_token is set to
# $USER, then when virtual user fred logs in, he will end up (usually chroot()'ed) in the directory
# /home/virtual/fred. This option also takes affect if local_root contains user_sub_token.
# Default: (none)

# vsftpd's use of restricted filesystem spaces (chroot). (Added in v2.0.6). Default: (none)
ca_certs_file=/etc/vsftpd/certs/ca_192.168.1.150.crt

# This option specifies the location of the RSA certificate to use for SSL encrypted connections.
# Default: /usr/share/ssl/certs/vsftpd.pem
rsa_cert_file=/etc/vsftpd/certs/server-vsftpd-morfikownia.lh.crt

# This option specifies the location of the RSA private key to use for SSL encrypted connections.
# If this option is not set, the private key is expected to be in the same file as the certificate.
# Default: (none)
rsa_private_key_file=/etc/vsftpd/certs/server-vsftpd-morfikownia.lh.key

# If enabled, vsftpd will request (but not necessarily require; see require_cert) a certificate on
# incoming SSL connections. Normally this should not cause any trouble at all, but IBM zOS seems to
# have issues. (New in v2.0.7). Default: YES
ssl_request_cert=YES

# If set to YES, all SSL client connections are required to present a client certificate. The
# degree of validation applied to this certificate is controlled by validate_cert (Added in v2.0.6).
# Default: NO
require_cert=NO

# If set to YES, all SSL client certificates received must validate OK. Self-signed certs do not
# constitute OK validation. (New in v2.0.6). Default: NO
validate_cert=YES

# Only applies if ssl_enable is activated. If enabled, this option will permit SSL v2 protocol
# connections. TLS v1 connections are preferred. Default: NO
ssl_sslv2=NO

# Only applies if ssl_enable is activated. If enabled, this option will permit SSL v3 protocol
# connections. TLS v1 connections are preferred. Default: NO
ssl_sslv3=NO

# Only applies if ssl_enable is activated. If enabled, this option will permit TLS v1 protocol
# connections. TLS v1 connections are preferred. Default: YES
ssl_tlsv1=YES

# This option can be used to select which SSL ciphers vsftpd will allow for encrypted SSL
# connections. See the "ciphers" man page for further details. Note that restricting ciphers can be
# a useful security precaution as it prevents malicious remote parties forcing a cipher which they
# have found problems with. Default: ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
ssl_ciphers=ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384

# Only applies if ssl_enable is active. If set to YES, anonymous users will be allowed to use
# secured SSL connections. Default: NO
allow_anon_ssl=YES

# Only applies if ssl_enable is activated. If activated, all anonymous logins are forced to use a
# secure SSL connection in order to send the password. Default: NO
force_anon_logins_ssl=NO

# Only applies if ssl_enable is activated. If activated, all anonymous logins are forced to use a
# secure SSL connection in order to send and receive data on data connections. Default: NO
force_anon_data_ssl=NO

# Only applies if ssl_enable is activated. If activated, all non-anonymous logins are forced to use
# a secure SSL connection in order to send the password. Default: YES
force_local_logins_ssl=NO

# Only applies if ssl_enable is activated. If activated, all non-anonymous logins are forced to use
# a secure SSL connection in order to send and receive data on data connections. Default: YES
force_local_data_ssl=NO

# If enabled, an SSL handshake is the first thing expect on all connections (the FTPS protocol). To
# support explicit SSL and/or plain text too, a separate vsftpd listener process should be run.
# Default: NO
implicit_ssl=NO

# If enabled, SSL data uploads are required to terminate via SSL, not an EOF on the socket. This
# option is required to be sure that an attacker did not terminate an upload prematurely with a
# faked TCP FIN. Unfortunately, it is not enabled by default because so few clients get it right.
# (New in v2.0.7). Default: NO
strict_ssl_read_eof=NO

# If enabled, SSL data downloads are required to terminate via SSL, not an EOF on the socket. This
# is off by default as I was unable to find a single FTP client that does this. It is minor. All it
# affects is our ability to tell whether the client confirmed full receipt of the file. Even
# without this option, the client is able to check the integrity of the download. (New in v2.0.7).
# Default: NO
strict_ssl_write_shutdown=NO

# If set to YES, all SSL data connections are required to exhibit SSL session reuse (which proves
# that they know the same master secret as the control channel). Although this is a secure default,
# it may break many FTP clients, so you may want to disable it. For a discussion of the
# consequences, see http://scarybeastsecurity.blogspot.com/2009/02/vsftpd-210-released.html (Added
# in v2.1.0). Default: YES
require_ssl_reuse=YES

# If true, OpenSSL connection diagnostics are dumped to the vsftpd log file. (Added in v2.0.6).
# Default: NO
debug_ssl=YES
