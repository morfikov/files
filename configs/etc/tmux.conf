#################################################################################################### 
#
# tmux allows a command to be bound to most keys, with or without a prefix key. When specifying
# keys, most represent themselves (for example "A" to "Z"). Ctrl keys may be prefixed with "C-" or
# "^", and Alt (meta) with "M-". In addition, the following special key names are accepted: Up,
# Down, Left, Right, BSpace, BTab, DC (Delete), End, Enter, Escape, F1 to F12, Home, IC (Insert),
# NPage/PageDown/PgDn, PPage/PageUp/PgUp, Space, and Tab. Note that to bind the """ or "'" keys,
# quotation marks are necessary, for example:
#
#   bind-key '"' split-window 
#   bind-key "'" new-window
#
#==================================#
# Commands related to key bindings #
#==================================#
#
# bind-key [-cnr] [-t mode-table] [-T key-table] key command [arguments]
#   (alias: bind), bind key key to command. Keys are bound in a key table. By default (without
#   "-T"), the key is bound in the prefix key table. This table is used for keys pressed after the
#   prefix key (for example, by default "c" is bound to "new-window" in the prefix table, so "C-b c"
#   creates a new window). The root table is used for keys pressed without the prefix key: binding
#   "c" to "new-window" in the root table (not recommended) means a plain "c" will create a new
#   window. "-n" is an alias for "-T root". Keys may also be bound in custom key tables and the
#   "switch-client -T" command used to switch to them from a key binding. The "-r" flag indicates
#   this key may repeat, see the repeat-time option. If "-t" is present, key is bound in
#   mode-table: the binding for command mode with "-c" or for normal mode without. See the
#   WINDOWS AND PANES section and the "list-keys" command for information on mode key bindings. To
#   view the default bindings and possible commands, see the list-keys command.
#
# list-keys [-t mode-table] [-T key-table]
#   (alias: lsk), list all key bindings. Without "-T" all key tables are printed. With "-T" only
#   key-table. With "-t", the key bindings in "mode-table" are listed; this may be one of: vi-edit,
#   emacs-edit, vi-choice, emacs-choice, vi-copy or emacs-copy.
#
# send-keys [-lMR] [-t target-pane] key ...
#   (alias: send), send a key or keys to a window. Each argument key is the name of the key (such
#   as "C-a" or "npage" ) to send; if the string is not recognized as a key, it is sent as a series
#   of characters. The "-l" flag disables key name lookup and sends the keys literally. All
#   arguments are sent sequentially from first to last. The "-R" flag causes the terminal state to
#   be reset. "-M" passes through a mouse event (only valid if bound to a mouse key binding, see
#   MOUSE SUPPORT).
#
# send-prefix [-2] [-t target-pane]
#   Sends the prefix key, or with -2 the secondary prefix key, to a window as if it was pressed.
#
# unbind-key [-acn] [-t mode-table] [-T key-table] key
#   (alias: unbind), unbind the command bound to key. "-c", "-n", "-T" and "-t" are the same as
#   for "bind-key". If "-a" is present, all key bindings are removed.

#                                              Options                                             #
#################################################################################################### 
#
# The appearance and behavior of tmux may be modified by changing the value of various options.
# There are three types of options: server options, session options and window options.
#
# The tmux server has a set of global options which do not apply to any particular window or
# session. These are altered with the "set-option -s" command, or displayed with the
# "show-options -s" command.
#
# In addition, each individual session may have a set of session options, and there is a separate
# set of global session options. Sessions which do not have a particular option configured, inherit
# the value from the global session options. Session options are set or unset with the "set-option"
# command and may be listed with the "show-options" command. The available server and session
# options are listed under the "set-option" command.
#
# Similarly, a set of window options is attached to each window, and there is a set of global
# window options from which any unset options are inherited. Window options are altered with the
# "set-window-option" command and can be listed with the "show-window-options" command. All window
# options are documented with the "set-window-option" command.
#
# tmux also supports user options which are prefixed with a "@". User options may have any name, so
# long as they are prefixed with "@", and be set to any string.
#
# set-option [-agoqsuw] [-t target-session | target-window] option value
#   (alias: set), set a window option with "-w" (equivalent to the "set-window-option" command),
#   a server option with "-s", otherwise a session option. If "-g" is given, the global session or
#   window option is set. The "-u" flag unsets an option, so a session inherits the option from the
#   global options (or with "-g", restores a global option to the default). The "-o" flag prevents
#   setting an option that is already set and the "-q" flag suppresses errors about unknown or
#   ambiguous options. With "-a", and if the option expects a string or a style, value is appended
#   to the existing setting. For example:
#     set -g status-left "foo" 
#     set -ag status-left "bar"
#
#   Will result in "foobar". And:
#     set -g status-style "bg=red" 
#     set -ag status-style "fg=blue"
#
#   Will result in a red background and blue foreground. Without -"a", the result would be the
#   default background and a blue foreground.
#
# set-window-option [-agoqu] [-t target-window] option value
#   (alias: setw), set a window option. The "-a", "-g", "-o", "-q" and "-u" flags work similarly to
#   the "set-option" command.
#
# show-options [-gqsvw] [-t target-session | target-window] [option]
#   (alias: show), show the window options (or a single window option if given) with "-w"
#   (equivalent to "show-window-options"), the server options with "-s", otherwise the session
#   options for target session. Global session or window options are listed if "-g" is used. "-v"
#   shows only the option value, not the name. If "-q" is set, no error will be returned if option
#   is unset.
#
# show-window-options [-gv] [-t target-window] [option]
#   (alias: showw), list the window options or a single option for target-window, or the global
#   window options if "-g" is used. "-v" shows only the option value, not the name.
#
# Values depend on the option and may be a number, a string, or a flag (on, off, or omitted to
# toggle).
#
#================#
# Server options #
#================#
#
# Set the number of buffers; as new buffers are added to the top of the stack, old ones are removed
# from the bottom if necessary to maintain this maximum length.
#set -g buffer-limit number
#
# Set the default terminal for new windows created in this session (the default value of the "TERM"
# environment variable). For tmux to work correctly, this must be set to "screen", "tmux" or a
# derivative of them, for example, "screen-256color".
set -s default-terminal screen-256color
#
# Set the time in milliseconds for which tmux waits after an escape is input to determine if it is
# part of a function or meta key sequences. The default is 500 milliseconds.
# note: "0" fixes pausing in vim
set -s escape-time 0
#
# If enabled, the server will exit when there are no attached clients. [on | off]
set -s exit-unattached off
#
# When enabled, focus events are requested from the terminal if supported and passed through to
# applications running in tmux. Attached clients should be detached and attached again after
# changing this option. [on | off]
#set -s focus-events on
#
# If not empty, a file to which tmux will write command prompt history on exit and load it from on
# start.
#set -s history-file path
#
# Set the number of error or information messages to save in the message log for each client. The
# default is 100.
#set -s message-limit number
#
# Attempt to set the terminal clipboard content using the \e]52;...\007 xterm(1) escape sequences.
# This option is "on" by default if there is an Ms entry in the terminfo(5) description for the
# client terminal. Note that this feature needs to be enabled in xterm(1) by setting the resource:
#
#   disallowedWindowOps: 20,21,SetXprop
#
# Or changing this property from the xterm(1) interactive menu when required. [on | off]
#set -s set-clipboard on
#
# Contains a list of entries which override terminal descriptions read using terminfo(5). String is
# a comma-separated list of items each a colon-separated string made up of a terminal type pattern
# (matched using fnmatch(3)) and a set of name=value entries.
#
# For example, to set the "clear" terminfo(5) entry to "\e[H\e[2J" for all terminal types and the
# "dch1" entry to "\e[P" for the "rxvt" terminal type, the option could be set to the string:
#set -s terminal-overrides "*:clear=\e[H\e[2J,rxvt:dch1=\e[P"
#
# The terminal entry value is passed through strunvis(3) before interpretation. The default value
# forcibly corrects the "colors" entry for terminals which support 256 colours:
#set -s terminal-overrides "*256col*:colors=256,xterm*:XT"
#
#=================#
# Session options #
#=================#

#
# Set action on window bell. [any | none | current | other]
#   "any" means a bell in any window linked to a session causes a bell in the current window of
#     that session.
#   "none" means all bells are ignored
#   "current" means only bells in windows other than the current window are ignored
#   "other" means bells in the current window are ignored but not those in other windows.
set -g bell-action none
#
# If "on", ring the terminal bell when an alert occurs.
#set bell-on-alert on
#
# Set the command used for new windows (if not specified when the window is created) to
# shell-command, which may be any sh(1) command. The default is an empty string, which instructs
# tmux to create a login shell using the value of the "default-shell" option.
set -g default-command /bin/zsh
#
# Specify the default shell. This is used as the login shell for new windows when the
# default-command option is set to empty, and must be the full path of the executable. When started
# tmux tries to set a default value from the first suitable of the SHELL environment variable, the
# shell returned by getpwuid(3), or /bin/sh. This option should be configured when tmux is used as
# a login shell. 
# set -g default-shell /bin/zsh
#
# If enabled and the session is no longer attached to any clients, it is destroyed. [on | off]

#                                            Mouse support                                         #
#################################################################################################### 
#
# If the mouse option is "on" (the default is "off"), tmux allows mouse events to be bound as keys.
# The name of each key is made up of a mouse event (such as "MouseUp1") and a location suffix (one
# of "Pane" for the contents of a pane, "Border" for a pane border or "Status" for the status line).
# The following mouse events are available:
#
#   MouseDown1    MouseUp1    MouseDrag1
#   MouseDown2    MouseUp2    MouseDrag2
#   MouseDown3    MouseUp3    MouseDrag3
#   WheelUp       WheelDown
#
# Each should be suffixed with a location, for example "MouseDown1Status".
#
# The special token "{mouse}" or "=" may be used as target-window or target-pane in commands bound
# to mouse key bindings. It resolves to the window or pane over which the mouse event took place
# (for example, the window in the status line over which button "1" was released for a
# "MouseUp1Status" binding, or the pane over which the wheel was scrolled for a "WheelDownPane"
# binding).
#
# The send-keys -M flag may be used to forward a mouse event to a pane.
#
# The default key bindings allow the mouse to be used to select and resize panes, to copy text and
# to change window using the status line. These take effect if the mouse option is turned on.

#################################################################################################### 
#
# Certain commands accept the "-F" flag with a format argument. This is a string which controls the
# output format of the command. Replacement variables are enclosed in "#{" and "}", for example
# "#{session_name}". The possible variables are listed in the table below, or the name of a tmux
# option may be used for an option's value. Some variables have a shorter alias such as "#S", and
# "##" is replaced by a single "#".
#
# Conditionals are available by prefixing with "?" and separating two alternatives with a comma; if
# the specified variable exists and is not zero, the first alternative is chosen, otherwise the
# second is used. For example "#{?session_attached,attached,not attached}" will include the string
# "attached" if the session is attached and the string "not attached" if it is unattached, or
# "#{?automatic-rename,yes,no}" will include "yes" if "automatic-rename" is enabled, or "no" if not.
#
# A limit may be placed on the length of the resultant string by prefixing it by an "=", a number
# and a colon, so "#{=10:pane_title}" will include at most the first 10 characters of the pane
# title. Prefixing a time variable with "t:" will convert it to a string, so if "#{window_activity}"
# gives "1445765102", "#{t:window_activity}" gives "Sun Oct 25 09:25:02 2015". The "b:" and "d:"
# prefixes are basename(3) and dirname(3) of the variable respectively. A prefix of the form
# "s/foo/bar/:" will substitute "foo" with "bar" throughout.
#
# In addition, the first line of a shell command's output may be inserted using "#()". For example,
# "#(uptime)" will insert the system's uptime. When constructing formats, tmux does not wait for
# "#()" commands to finish; instead, the previous result from running the same command is used, or
# a placeholder if the command has not been run before. Commands are executed with the tmux global
# environment set (see the ENVIRONMENT section).
#
# The following variables are available, where appropriate:

#################################################################################################### 
#
# tmux distinguishes between names and titles. Windows and sessions have names, which may be used
# to specify them in targets and are displayed in the status line and various lists: the name is
# the tmux identifier for a window or session. Only panes have titles. A pane's title is typically
# set by the program running inside the pane and is not modified by tmux. It is the same mechanism
# used to set for example the xterm(1) window title in an X(7) window manager. Windows themselves
# do not have titles - a window's title is the title of its active pane. tmux itself may set the
# title of the terminal in which the client is running, see the set-titles option.
#
# A session's name is set with the "new-session" and "rename-session" commands. A window's name is
# set with one of:
#
#   1. A command argument (such as -n for new-window or new-session).
#   2. An escape sequence:
#        $ printf '\033kWINDOW_NAME\033\\'
#   3. Automatic renaming, which sets the name to the active command in the window's active pane.
#        See the "automatic-rename" option.
#
# When a pane is first created, its title is the hostname. A pane's title can be set via the OSC
# title setting sequence, for example:
#
#   $ printf '\033]2;My Title\033\\'

#################################################################################################### 
#
# When the server is started, tmux copies the environment into the global environment; in addition,
# each session has a session environment. When a window is created, the session and global
# environments are merged. If a variable exists in both, the value from the session environment is
# used. The result is the initial environment passed to the new process.
#
# The "update-environment" session option may be used to update the session environment from the
# client when a new session is created or an old reattached. tmux also initialises the TMUX
# variable with some internal information to allow commands to be executed from inside, and the
# TERM variable with the correct terminal setting of "screen".
#
#============================================#
# Commands to alter and view the environment #
#============================================#
#
# set-environment [-gru] [-t target-session] name [value]
#   (alias: setenv), set or unset an environment variable. If "-g" is used, the change is made in
#   the global environment; otherwise, it is applied to the session environment for
#   "target-session". The "-u" flag unsets a variable. "-r" indicates the variable is to be removed
#   from the environment before starting a new process.
#
# show-environment [-gs] [-t target-session] [variable]
#   (alias: showenv), display the environment for "target-session" or the global environment with
#   "-g". If variable is omitted, all variables are shown. Variables removed from the environment
#   are prefixed with "-". If "-s" is used, the output is formatted as a set of Bourne shell
#   commands.

#                                           Status line                                            #
#################################################################################################### 
#
# tmux includes an optional status line which is displayed in the bottom line of each terminal. By
# default, the status line is enabled (it may be disabled with the status session option) and
# contains, from left-to-right: the name of the current session in square brackets; the window list;
# the title of the active pane in double quotes; and the time and date.
#
# The status line is made of three parts: configurable left and right sections (which may contain
# dynamic content such as the time or output from a shell command, see the "status-left",
# "status-left-length", "status-right", and "status-right-length" options below), and a central
# window list. By default, the window list shows the index, name and (if any) flag of the windows
# present in the current session in ascending numerical order. It may be customized with the
# "window-status-format" and "window-status-current-format" options. The flag is one of the
# following symbols appended to the window name:
#
#   Symbol    Meaning
#     *       Denotes the current window.
#     -       Marks the last window (previously selected).
#     #       Window is monitored and activity has been detected.
#     !       A bell has occurred in the window.
#     ~       The window has been silent for the monitor-silence interval.
#     M       The window contains the marked pane.
#     Z       The window's active pane is zoomed.
#
# The "#" symbol relates to the "monitor-activity" window option. The window name is printed in
# inverted colors if an alert (bell, activity or silence) is present.
#
# The color and attributes of the status line may be configured, the entire status line using the
# "status-style" session option and individual windows using the "window-status-style" window
# option.
#
# The status line is automatically refreshed at interval if it has changed, the interval may be
# controlled with the "status-interval" session option.
#
#=====================================#
# Commands related to the status line #
#=====================================#
#
# command-prompt [-I inputs] [-p prompts] [-t target-client] [template]
#    Open the command prompt in a client. This may be used from inside tmux to execute commands
#    interactively. If template is specified, it is used as the command. If present, "-I" is a
#    comma-separated list of the initial text for each prompt. If "-p" is given, prompts is a
#    comma-separated list of prompts which are displayed in order; otherwise a single prompt is
#    displayed, constructed from template if it is present, or ":" if not.
#
#    Both inputs and prompts may contain the special character sequences supported by the
#    "status-left" option. Before the command is executed, the first occurrence of the string "%%"
#    and all occurrences of "%1" are replaced by the response to the first prompt, the second "%%"
#    and all "%2" are replaced with the response to the second prompt, and so on for further
#    prompts. Up to nine prompt responses may be replaced ("%1" to "%9").
#
# confirm-before [-p prompt] [-t target-client] command
#   (alias: confirm), ask for confirmation before executing command. If "-p" is given, prompt is
#   the prompt to display; otherwise a prompt is constructed from command. It may contain the
#   special character sequences supported by the "status-left" option.
#
# display-message [-p] [-c target-client] [-t target-pane] [message]
#   (alias: display), work only from inside tmux and displays a message. If "-p" is given, the
#   output is printed to stdout, otherwise it is displayed in the target-client status line. The
#   format of message is described in the FORMATS section; information is taken from target-pane if
#   "-t" is given, otherwise the active pane for the session attached to target-client.

#################################################################################################### 
#
# tmux maintains a set of named paste buffers. Each buffer may be either explicitly or
# automatically named. Explicitly named buffers are named when created with the "set-buffer" or
# "load-buffer" commands, or by renaming an automatically named buffer with "set-buffer -n".
# Automatically named buffers are given a name such as "buffer0001", "buffer0002" and so on. When
# the "buffer-limit" option is reached, the oldest automatically named buffer is deleted.
# Explicitly named are not subject to "buffer-limit" and may be deleted with "delete-buffer"
# command.
#
# Buffers may be added using "copy-mode" or the "set-buffer" and "load-buffer" commands, and pasted
# into a window using the paste-buffer command. If a buffer command is used and no buffer is
# specified, the most recently added automatically named buffer is assumed.
#
# A configurable history buffer is also maintained for each window. By default, up to 2000 lines
# are kept; this can be altered with the "history-limit" option (see the "set-option" command
# above).
#
#=====================#
# The buffer commands #
#=====================#
#
# choose-buffer [-F format] [-t target-window] [template]
#    Put a window into buffer choice mode, where a buffer may be chosen interactively from a list.
#    After a buffer is selected, "%%" is replaced by the buffer name in template and the result
#    executed as a command. If template is not given, "paste-buffer -b '%%'" is used. For the
#    meaning of the "-F" flag, see the FORMATS section. This command works only if at least one
#    client is attached.
#
# clear-history [-t target-pane]
#   (alias: clearhist), remove and frees the history for the specified pane.
#
# delete-buffer [-b buffer-name]
#   (alias: deleteb), delete the buffer named "buffer-name", or the most recently added
#   automatically named buffer if not specified.
#
# list-buffers [-F format]
#   (alias: lsb), list the global buffers. For the meaning of the "-F" flag, see the FORMATS
#   section.
#
# load-buffer [-b buffer-name] path
#   (alias: loadb), load the contents of the specified paste buffer from path.
#
# paste-buffer [-dpr] [-b buffer-name] [-s separator] [-t target-pane]
#   (alias: pasteb), insert the contents of a paste buffer into the specified pane. If not
#   specified, paste into the current one. With "-d", also delete the paste buffer. When output,
#   any linefeed (LF) characters in the paste buffer are replaced with a separator, by default
#   carriage return (CR). A custom separator may be specified using the "-s" flag. The "-r" flag
#   means to do no replacement (equivalent to a separator of LF). If "-p" is specified, paste
#   bracket control codes are inserted around the buffer if the application has requested bracketed
#   paste mode.
#
# save-buffer [-a] [-b buffer-name] path
#   (alias: saveb), save the contents of the specified paste buffer to path. The "-a" option
#   appends to rather than overwriting the file.
#
# set-buffer [-a] [-b buffer-name] [-n new-buffer-name] data
#   (alias: setb), set the contents of the specified buffer to data. The "-a" option appends to
#   rather than overwriting the buffer. The -n option renames the buffer to new-buffer-name.
#
# show-buffer [-b buffer-name]
#   (alias: showb), display the contents of the specified buffer.

#################################################################################################### 
#
# Miscellaneous commands are as follows:
#
# clock-mode [-t target-pane]
#   Display a large clock.
#
# if-shell [-bF] [-t target-pane] shell-command command [command]
#   (alias: if), executes the first command if "shell-command" returns success or the second
#   command otherwise. Before being executed, "shell-command" is expanded using the rules specified
#   in the FORMATS section, including those relevant to target-pane. With "-b", "shell-command" is
#   run in the background. If "-F" is given, "shell-command" is not executed but considered success
#   if neither empty nor zero (after formats are expanded).
#
# lock-server
#   (alias: lock), lock each client individually by running the command specified by the
#   "lock-command" option.
#
# run-shell [-b] [-t target-pane] shell-command
#   (alias: run), execute "shell-command" in the background without creating a window. Before being
#   executed, "shell-command" is expanded using the rules specified in the FORMATS section. With
#   "-b", the command is run in the background. After it finishes, any output to stdout is
#   displayed in copy mode (in the pane specified by "-t" or the current pane if omitted). If the
#   command doesn't return success, the exit status is also displayed.
#
# wait-for [-L | -S | -U] channel
#   (alias: wait), when used without options, prevents the client from exiting until woken using
#   "wait-for -S" with the same channel. When "-L" is used, the channel is locked and any clients
#   that try to lock the same channel are made to wait until the channel is unlocked with
#   "wait-for -U". This command only works from outside tmux.

#                                       Clients and sessions                                       #
#################################################################################################### 
#
# The tmux server manages clients, sessions, windows and panes. Clients are attached to sessions to
# interact with them, either when they are created with the "new-session" command, or later with
# the "attach-session" command. Each session has one or more windows linked into it. Windows may be
# linked to multiple sessions and are made up of one or more panes, each of which contains a pseudo
# terminal. Commands for creating, linking and otherwise manipulating windows are covered in the
# WINDOWS AND PANES section.
#
#=========================================#
# Commands to manage clients and sessions #
#=========================================#
#
# attach-session [-dEr] [-c working-directory] [-t target-session]
#   (alias: attach), if run from outside tmux, create a new client in the current terminal and
#   attach it to "target-session". If used from inside, switch the current client. If "-d" is
#   specified, any other clients attached to the session are detached. "-r" signifies the client is
#   read-only (only keys bound to the detach-client or switch-client commands have any effect). If
#   no server is started, "attach-session" will attempt to start it; this will fail unless sessions
#   are created in the configuration file. The "target-session" rules for "attach-session" are
#   slightly adjusted: if tmux needs to select the most recently used session, it will prefer the
#   most recently used unattached session. "-c" will set the session working directory (used for
#   new windows) to working-directory. If "-E" is used, update-environment option will not be
#   applied.
#
# detach-client [-aP] [-s target-session] [-t target-client]
#   (alias: detach), detach the current client if bound to a key, the client specified with "-t",
#   or all clients currently attached to the session specified by "-s". The "-a" option kills all
#   but the client given with "-t". If -"P" is given, send SIGHUP to the parent process of the
#   client, typically causing it to exit.
#
# has-session [-t target-session]
#   (alias: has), report an error and exit with 1 if the specified session does not exist. If it
#   does exist, exit with 0.
#
# kill-server
#   Kills the tmux server and clients and destroy all sessions.
#
# kill-session [-aC] [-t target-session]
#   Destroy the given session, closing any windows linked to it and no other sessions, and
#   detaching all clients attached to it. If "-a" is given, all sessions but the specified one is
#   killed. The "-C" flag clears alerts (bell, activity, or silence) in all windows linked to the
#   session.
#
# list-clients [-F format] [-t target-session]
#   (alias: lsc), list all clients attached to the server. For the meaning of the "-F" flag, see
#   the FORMATS section. If "target-session" is specified, list only clients connected to that
#   session.
#
# list-commands
#   (alias: lscm), list the syntax of all commands supported by tmux.
#
# list-sessions [-F format]
#   (alias: ls), list all sessions managed by the server. For the meaning of the "-F" flag, see the
#   FORMATS section.
#
# lock-client [-t target-client]
#   (alias: lockc), lock "target-client", see the "lock-server" command.
#
# lock-session [-t target-session]
#   (alias: locks), lock all clients attached to "target-session".
#
# new-session [-AdDEP] [-c start-directory] [-F format] [-n window-name] [-s session-name] \
#                      [-t target-session] [-x width] [-y height] [shell-command]
#   (alias: new), create a new session with name session-name. The new session is attached to the
#   current terminal unless -d is given. window-name and shell-command are the name of and shell
#   command to execute in the initial window. If "-d" is used, "-x" and "-y" specify the size of
#   the initial window (80 by 24 if not given). If run from a terminal, any termios(4) special
#   characters are saved and used for new windows in the new session. The "-A" flag makes
#   "new-session" behave like "attach-session" if "session-name" already exists; in this case, "-D"
#   behaves like "-d" to attach-session. If "-t" is given, the new session is grouped with
#   "target-session". This means they share the same set of windows - all windows from
#   "target-session" are linked to the new session and any subsequent new windows or windows being
#   closed are applied to both sessions. The current and previous window and any session options
#   remain independent and either session may be killed without affecting the other. Giving "-n" or
#   shell-command are invalid if "-t" is used. The "-P" option prints information about the new
#   session after it has been created. By default, it uses the format "#{session_name}:" but a
#   different format may be specified with "-F". If "-E" is used, "update-environment" option will
#   not be applied.
#
# refresh-client [-S] [-t target-client]
#   (alias: refresh), refreshe the current client if bound to a key, or a single client if one is
#   given with "-t". If "-S" is specified, only update the client's status bar.
#
# rename-session [-t target-session] new-name
#   (alias: rename), renames the session to "new-name".
#
# show-messages [-JT] [-t target-client]
#   (alias: showmsgs), show client messages or server information. Any messages displayed on the
#   status line are saved in a per-client message log, up to a maximum of the limit set by the
#   "message-limit" server option. With "-t", display the log for target-client. "-J" and "-T" show
#   debugging information about jobs and terminals.
#
# source-file path
#   (alias: source), execute commands from path.
#
# start-server
#   (alias: start), start the tmux server, if not already running, without creating any sessions.
#
# suspend-client [-t target-client]
#   (alias: suspendc), suspend a client by sending SIGTSTP (tty stop).
#
# switch-client [-Elnpr] [-c target-client] [-t target-session] [-T key-table]
#   (alias: switchc), switche the current session for client "target-client" to "target-session".
#   If "-l", "-n" or "-p" is used, the client is moved to the last, next or previous session
#   respectively. "-r" toggles whether a client is read-only (see the "attach-session" command). If
#   "-E" is used, "update-environment" option will not be applied. "-T" sets the client's key table;
#   the next key from the client will be interpreted from "key-table". This may be used to
#   configure multiple prefix keys, or to bind commands to sequences of keys. For example, to make
#   typing "abc" run the "list-keys" command:
#     bind-key -Ttable2 c list-keys 
#     bind-key -Ttable1 b switch-client -Ttable2 
#     bind-key -Troot   a switch-client -Ttable1

# A tmux window may be in one of several modes. The default permits direct access to the terminal
# attached to the window. The other is copy mode, which permits a section of a window or its
# history to be copied to a paste buffer for later insertion into another window. This mode is
# entered with the "copy-mode" command, bound to "[" by default. It is also entered when a command
# that produces output, such as "list-keys", is executed from a key binding.
#
# The keys available depend on whether "emacs" or "vi" mode is selected (see the "mode-keys"
# option). The following keys are supported as appropriate for the mode:

# The next and previous word keys use space and the "-", "_" and "@" characters as word delimiters
# by default, but this can be adjusted by setting the "word-separators" session option. Next word
# moves to the start of the next word, next word end to the end of the next word and previous word
# to the start of the previous word. The three next and previous space keys work similarly but use
# a space alone as the word separator.
#
# The jump commands enable quick movement within a line. For instance, typing "f" followed by "/"
# will move the cursor to the next "/" character on the current line. A ";" will then jump to the
# next occurrence.
#
# Commands in "copy-mode" may be prefaced by an optional repeat count. With "vi" key bindings, a
# prefix is entered using the number keys; with "emacs", the Alt (meta) key and a number begins
# prefix entry. For example, to move the cursor forward by ten words, use "M-1 0 M-f" in emacs mode,
# and "10w" in "vi".
#
# Mode key bindings are defined in a set of named tables: vi-edit and emacs-edit for keys used when
# line editing at the command prompt; vi-choice and emacs-choice for keys used when choosing from
# lists (such as produced by the "choose-window command"); and vi-copy and emacs-copy used in
# "copy-mode". The tables may be viewed with the "list-keys" command and keys modified or removed
# with "bind-key" and "unbind-key". If "append-selection", "copy-selection", or "start-named-buffer"
# are given the "-x" flag, tmux will not exit copy mode after copying. "copy-pipe" copies the
# selection and pipes it to a command. For example the following will bind "C-w" not to exit after
# copying and "C-q" to copy the selection into /tmp/ as well as the paste buffer:
#   bind-key -temacs-copy C-w copy-selection -x 
#   bind-key -temacs-copy C-q copy-pipe "cat >/tmp/out"
#
# The paste buffer key pastes the first line from the top paste buffer on the stack.
#
#========================================#
# The synopsis for the copy-mode command #
#========================================#
#
# copy-mode [-Meu] [-t target-pane]
#   Enter "copy-mode". The "-u" option scrolls one page up. "-M" begins a mouse drag (only valid if
#   bound to a mouse key binding, see MOUSE SUPPORT). "-e" specifies that scrolling to the bottom
#   of the history (to the visible screen) should exit copy mode. While in "copy-mode", pressing a
#   key other than those used for scrolling will disable this behaviour. This is intended to allow
#   fast scrolling through a pane's history, for example with: "bind PageUp copy-mode -eu".
#
# Each window displayed by tmux may be split into one or more panes; each pane takes up a certain
# area of the display and is a separate terminal. A window may be split into panes using the
# "split-window" command. Windows may be split horizontally (with the "-h" flag) or vertically.
# Panes may be resized with the "resize-pane" command (bound to "C-up", "C-down", "C-left" and
# "C-right" by default), the current pane may be changed with the "select-pane" command and the
# "rotate-window and "swap-pane" commands may be used to swap panes without changing their position.
# Panes are numbered beginning from zero in the order they are created.
#
# A number of preset layouts are available. These may be selected with the "select-layout" command
# or cycled with "next-layout" (bound to "Space" by default); once a layout is chosen, panes within
# it may be moved and resized as normal.
#
#=========#
# Layouts #
#=========#
#
# Panes are spread out evenly from left to right across the window.
#   even-horizontal
#
# Panes are spread evenly from top to bottom.
#   even-vertical
#
# A large (main) pane is shown at the top of the window and the remaining panes are spread from
# left to right in the leftover space at the bottom. Use the "main-pane-height" window option to
# specify the height of the top pane.
#   main-horizontal
#
# Similar to "main-horizontal" but the large pane is placed on the left and the others spread from
# top to bottom along the right. See the "main-pane-width" window option.
#   main-vertical
#
# Panes are spread out as evenly as possible over the window in both rows and columns.
#   tiled
#
# In addition, "select-layout" may be used to apply a previously used layout - the "list-windows"
# command displays the layout of each window in a form suitable for use with "select-layout". For
# example:
#
#   $ tmux list-windows 
#   0: ksh [159x48] 
#       layout: bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0} 
#   $ tmux select-layout bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}
#
# tmux automatically adjusts the size of the layout for the current window size. Note that a layout
# cannot be applied to a window with more panes than that from which the layout was originally
# defined.
#
#=======================================#
# Commands related to windows and panes #
#=======================================#
#
# break-pane [-dP] [-F format] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-pane]
#   (alias: breakp), break "src-pane" off from its containing window to make it the only pane in
#   "dst-window". If "-d" is given, the new window does not become the current window. The "-P"
#   option prints information about the new window after it has been created. By default, it uses
#   the format "#{session_name}:#{window_index}" but a different format may be specified with "-F".
#
# capture-pane [-aepPq] [-b buffer-name] [-E end-line] [-S start-line] [-t target-pane]
#   (alias: capturep), capture the contents of a pane. If "-p" is given, the output goes to stdout,
#   otherwise to the buffer specified with "-b" or a new buffer if omitted. If "-a" is given, the
#   alternate screen is used, and the history is not accessible. If no alternate screen exists, an
#   error will be returned unless "-q" is given. If "-e" is given, the output includes escape
#   sequences for text and background attributes. "-C" also escapes non-printable characters as
#   octal \xxx. "-J" joins wrapped lines and preserves trailing spaces at each line's end. "-P"
#   captures only any output that the pane has received that is the beginning of an as-yet
#   incomplete escape sequence. "-S" and "-E" specify the starting and ending line numbers, zero is
#   the first line of the visible pane and negative numbers are lines in the history. "-" to "-S"
#   is the start of the history and to "-E" the end of the visible pane. The default is to capture
#   only the visible contents of the pane.
#
# choose-client [-F format] [-t target-window] [template]
#   Put a window into client choice mode, allowing a client to be selected interactively from a
#   list. After a client is chosen, "%%" is replaced by the client pty(4) path in template and the
#   result executed as a command. If template is not given, "detach-client -t '%%'" is used. For
#   the meaning of the "-F" flag, see the FORMATS section. This command works only if at least one
#   client is attached.
#
# choose-session [-F format] [-t target-window] [template]
#   Put a window into session choice mode, where a session may be selected interactively from a
#   list. When one is chosen, "%%" is replaced by the session name in template and the result
#   executed as a command. If template is not given, "switch-client -t '%%'" is used. For the
#   meaning of the "-F" flag, see the FORMATS section. This command works only if at least one
#   client is attached.
#
# choose-tree [-suw] [-b session-template] [-c window-template] [-S format] [-W format] \
#                    [-t target-window]
#   Put a window into tree choice mode, where either sessions or windows may be selected
#   interactively from a list. By default, windows belonging to a session are indented to show
#   their relationship to a session. Note that the "choose-window" and "choose-session" commands
#   are wrappers around choose-tree.
#
#   If "-s" is given, will show sessions. If "-w" is given, will show windows. By default, the tree
#   is collapsed and sessions must be expanded to windows with the right arrow key. The "-u" option
#   will start with all sessions expanded instead. If "-b" is given, will override the default
#   session command. Note that "%%" can be used and will be replaced with the session name. The
#   default option if not specified is "switch-client -t '%%'". If "-c" is given, will override the
#   default window command. Like "-b", "%%" can be used and will be replaced with the session name
#   and window index. When a window is chosen from the list, the session command is run before the
#   window command. If "-S" is given will display the specified format instead of the default
#   session format. If "-W" is given will display the specified format instead of the default
#   window format. For the meaning of the "-s" and "-w" options, see the FORMATS section. This
#   command works only if at least one client is attached.
#
# choose-window [-F format] [-t target-window] [template]
#   Put a window into window choice mode, where a window may be chosen interactively from a list.
#   After a window is selected, "%%" is replaced by the session name and window index in template
#   and the result executed as a command. If template is not given, "select-window -t '%%'" is used.
#   For the meaning of the "-F" flag, see the FORMATS section. This command works only if at least
#   one client is attached.
#
# display-panes [-t target-client]
#   (alias: displayp), display a visible indicator of each pane shown by "target-client". See the
#   "display-panes-time", "display-panes-colour", and "display-panes-active-colour" session options.
#   While the indicator is on screen, a pane may be selected with the "0" to "9" keys.
#
# find-window [-CNT] [-F format] [-t target-window] match-string
#   (alias: findw), search for the fnmatch(3) pattern "match-string" in window names, titles, and
#   visible content (but not history). The flags control matching behavior: "-C" matches only
#   visible window contents, "-N" matches only the window name and "-T" matches only the window
#   title. The default is "-CNT". If only one window is matched, it'll be automatically selected,
#   otherwise a choice list is shown. For the meaning of the "-F" flag, see the FORMATS section.
#   This command works only if at least one client is attached.
#
# join-pane [-bdhv] [-l size | -p percentage] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-pane]
#   (alias: joinp), like "split-window", but instead of splitting "dst-pane" and creating a new
#   pane, split it and move "src-pane" into the space. This can be used to reverse "break-pane".
#   The "-b" option causes "src-pane" to be joined to left of or above "dst-pane". If "-s" is
#   omitted and a marked pane is present (see: "select-pane -m"), the marked pane is used rather
#   than the current pane.
#
# kill-pane [-a] [-t target-pane]
#   (alias: killp), sestroy the given pane. If no panes remain in the containing window, it is also
#   destroyed. The "-a" option kills all but the pane given with "-t".
#
# kill-window [-a] [-t target-window]
#   (alias: killw), kill the current window or the window at "target-window", removing it from any
#   sessions to which it is linked. The "-a" option kills all but the window given with "-t".
#
# last-pane [-de] [-t target-window]
#   (alias: lastp), select the last (previously selected) pane. "-e" enables or "-d" disables input
#   to the pane.
#
# last-window [-t target-session]
#   (alias: last), select the last (previously selected) window. If no "target-session" is
#   specified, select the last window of the current session.
#
# link-window [-adk] [-s src-window] [-t dst-window]
#   (alias: linkw), link the window at "src-window" to the specified "dst-window". If "dst-window"
#   is specified and no such window exists, the "src-window" is linked there. With "-a", the window
#   is moved to the next index up (following windows are moved if necessary). If "-k" is given and
#   "dst-window" exists, it is killed, otherwise an error is generated. If "-d" is given, the newly
#   linked window is not selected.
#
# list-panes [-as] [-F format] [-t target]
#   (alias: lsp), if "-a" is given, target is ignored and all panes on the server are listed. If
#   "-s" is given, target is a session (or the current session). If neither is given, target is a
#   window (or the current window). For the meaning of the "-F" flag, see the FORMATS section.
#
# list-windows [-a] [-F format] [-t target-session]
#   (alias: lsw), if "-a" is given, list all windows on the server. Otherwise, list windows in the
#   current session or in "target-session". For the meaning of the "-F" flag, see the FORMATS
#   section.
#
# move-pane [-bdhv] [-l size | -p percentage] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-pane]
#   (alias: movep), like "join-pane", but "src-pane" and "dst-pane" may belong to the same window.
#
# move-window [-ardk] [-s src-window] [-t dst-window]
#   (alias: movew), this is similar to "link-window", except the window at "src-window" is moved to
#   "dst-window". With "-r", all windows in the session are renumbered in sequential order,
#   respecting the base-index option.
#
# new-window [-adkP] [-c start-directory] [-F format] [-n window-name] [-t target-window] \
#                    [shell-command]
#   (alias: neww), create a new window. With "-a", the new window is inserted at the next index up
#   from the specified "target-window", moving windows up if necessary, otherwise "target-window"
#   is the new window location. If "-d" is given, the session does not make the new window the
#   current window. "target-window" represents the window to be created; if the target already
#   exists an error is shown, unless the "-k" flag is used, in which case it is destroyed.
#   "shell-command" is the command to execute. If "shell-command" is not specified, the value of
#   the "default-command" option is used. "-c" specifies the working directory in which the new
#   window is created. When the shell command completes, the window closes. See the "remain-on-exit"
#   option to change this behaviour. The TERM environment variable must be set to "screen" for all
#   programs running inside tmux. New windows will automatically have "TERM=screen" added to their
#   environment, but care must be taken not to reset this in shell start-up files. The "-P" option
#   prints information about the new window after it has been created. By default, it uses the
#   format "#{session_name}:#{window_index}" but a different format may be specified with "-F".
#
# next-layout [-t target-window]
#   (alias: nextl), move a window to the next layout and rearrange the panes to fit.
#
# next-window [-a] [-t target-session]
#   (alias: next), move to the next window in the session. If "-a" is used, move to the next window
#   with an alert.
#
# pipe-pane [-o] [-t target-pane] [shell-command]
#   (alias: pipep), pipe any output sent by the program in "target-pane" to a shell command. A pane
#   may only be piped to one command at a time, any existing pipe is closed before "shell-command"
#   is executed. The "shell-command" string may contain the special character sequences supported
#   by the "status-left" option. If no "shell-command" is given, the current pipe (if any) is
#   closed. The "-o" option only opens a new pipe if no previous pipe exists, allowing a pipe to be
#   toggled with a single key, for example:
#     bind-key C-p pipe-pane -o 'cat >> ~/output.#I-#P'
#
# previous-layout [-t target-window]
#   (alias: prevl), move to the previous layout in the session.
#
# previous-window [-a] [-t target-session]
#   (alias: prev), move to the previous window in the session. With "-a", move to the previous
#    window with an alert.
#
# rename-window [-t target-window] new-name
#   (alias: renamew), rename the current window, or the window at "target-window" if specified, to
#   "new-name".
#
# resize-pane [-DLMRUZ] [-t target-pane] [-x width] [-y height] [adjustment]
#   (alias: resizep), resize a pane, up, down, left or right by adjustment with "-U", "-D", "-L" or
#   "-R", or to an absolute size with "-x" or "-y". The adjustment is given in lines or cells
#   (the default is 1). With "-Z", the active pane is toggled between zoomed (occupying the whole
#   of the window) and unzoomed (its normal position in the layout). "-M" begins mouse resizing
#   (only valid if bound to a mouse key binding, see MOUSE SUPPORT).
#
# respawn-pane [-k] [-t target-pane] [shell-command]
#   (alias: respawnp), reactivate a pane in which the command has exited (see the "remain-on-exit"
#   window option). If "shell-command" is not given, the command used when the pane was created is
#   executed. The pane must be already inactive, unless "-k" is given, in which case any existing
#   command is killed.
#
# respawn-window [-k] [-t target-window] [shell-command]
#   (alias: respawnw), reactivate a window in which the command has exited (see the "remain-on-exit"
#   window option). If "shell-command" is not given, the command used when the window was created
#   is executed. The window must be already inactive, unless "-k" is given, in which case any
#   existing command is killed.
#
# rotate-window [-DU] [-t target-window]
#   (alias: rotatew), rotate the positions of the panes within a window, either upward (numerically
#   lower) with "-U" or downward (numerically higher).
#
# select-layout [-nop] [-t target-window] [layout-name]
#   (alias: selectl), choose a specific layout for a window. If "layout-name" is not given, the
#   last preset layout used (if any) is reapplied. "-n" and "-p" are equivalent to the "next-layout"
#   and "previous-layout" commands. "-o" applies the last set layout if possible (undoes the most
#   recent layout change).
#
# select-pane [-DdegLlMmRU] [-P style] [-t target-pane]
#   (alias: selectp), make pane "target-pane" the active pane in window "target-window", or set its
#   style (with "-P"). If one of "-D", "-L", "-R", or "-U" is used, respectively the pane below, to
#   the left, to the right, or above the target pane is used. "-l" is the same as using the
#   "last-pane" command. "-e" enables or "-d" disables input to the pane. "-m" and "-M" are used to
#   set and clear the marked pane. There is one marked pane at a time, setting a new marked pane
#   clears the last. The marked pane is the default target for "-s" to "join-pane", "swap-pane" and
#   "swap-window". Each pane has a style: by default the "window-style" and "window-active-style"
#   options are used, "select-pane -P" sets the style for a single pane. For example, to set the
#   pane 1 background to red: "select-pane -t:.1 -P 'bg=red'". "-g" shows the current pane style.
#
# select-window [-lnpT] [-t target-window]
#   (alias: selectw), select the window at "target-window". "-l", "-n" and "-p" are equivalent to
#   the "last-window", "next-window" and "previous-window" commands. If "-T" is given and the
#   selected window is already the current window, the command behaves like "last-window".
#
# split-window [-bdhvP] [-c start-directory] [-l size | -p percentage] [-t target-pane] \
#                        [shell-command] [-F format]
#   (alias: splitw), create a new pane by splitting "target-pane": "-h" does a horizontal split and
#   "-v" a vertical split; if neither is specified, "-v" is assumed. The "-l" and "-p" options
#   specify the size of the new pane in lines (for vertical split) or in cells (for horizontal
#   split), or as a percentage, respectively. The "-b" option causes the new pane to be created to
#   the left of or above "target-pane". All other options have the same meaning as for the
#   "new-window" command.
#
# swap-pane [-dDU] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-pane]
#   (alias: swapp), swap two panes. If "-U" is used and no source pane is specified with "-s",
#   "dst-pane" is swapped with the previous pane (before it numerically); "-D" swaps with the next
#   pane (after it numerically). "-d" instructs tmux not to change the active pane. If "-s" is
#   omitted and a marked pane is present (see: "select-pane -m"), the marked pane is used rather
#   than the current pane.
#
# swap-window [-d] [-s src-window] [-t dst-window]
#   (alias: swapw), this is similar to "link-window", except the source and destination windows are
#   swapped. It is an error if no window exists at "src-window". Like "swap-pane", if "-s" is
#   omitted and a marked pane is present (see:"select-pane -m"), the window containing the marked
#   pane is used rather than the current window.
#
# unlink-window [-k] [-t target-window]
#   (alias: unlinkw), unlink "target-window". Unless "-k" is given, a window may be unlinked only
#   if it is linked to multiple sessions - windows may not be linked to no sessions; if "-k" is
#   specified and the window is linked to only one session, it is unlinked and destroyed.
