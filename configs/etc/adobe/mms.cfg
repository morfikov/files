#

# If this value is set to 1, SWF files cannot access webcams or microphones. If this value is 0,
# the Settings Manager or Settings tabs let the user specify settings for access to webcams and
# microphones. If this value is set to 1, the privacy pop-up dialog never appears. However, the
# user can still access the Privacy tab and the Settings Manager, as well as tabs to let them
# designate which camera or microphone an application can use. These settings appear functional,
# but any choices the user makes are ignored. Also the recording level meter on the Microphone tab
# is disabled, and the Camera tab does not bring up a thumbnail of what the camera is seeing.
#
AVHardwareDisable = 1

# If the AVHardwareDisable value is set to 1, it prohibits SWF files from accessing webcams or
# microphones. The AVHardwareEnabledDomain settings provide exceptions to that rule. They create a
# "white list" of approved domain names or IP addresses to which data can be transmitted using a
# webcam or microphone. If the active security context is in the list of domains and IP addresses
# then camera and microphone access will be allowed. Otherwise it will default to the behavior
# specified by the AVHardwareDisable setting. This value must be set to a string containing a full
# domain name or IP address. The string value must exactly match the domain name or IP address to
# be enabled. Strings with wildcards such as *.adobe.com or 10.1.1.* are not supported. The mms.cfg
# file can contain multiple AVHardwareEnabledDomain settings to allow access to multiple domains
# and IP addresses. For example the following settings only allow access to cameras or microphones
# when connected to servers with the domain name test.mydomain.com or the IP address 10.1.1.10:
#
#AVHardwareEnabledDomain = test.mydomain.com
#AVHardwareEnabledDomain = 10.1.1.10

# This setting controls whether the Font.enumerateFonts() method in ActionScript 3.0 and the
# TextField.getFontList() method in ActionScript 1.0 and 2.0 return the list of fonts installed on
# a user’s system. If this value is 1, information on installed fonts cannot be returned. If this
# value is 0 (the default), information on installed fonts can be returned.
#
DisableDeviceFontEnumeration = 1

# This setting controls whether a SWF file playing via a browser plug-in can be displayed in
# full-screen mode; that is, taking up the entire screen and thus obscuring all application windows
# and system controls. If you set this value to 1, SWF files that attempt to play in full-screen
# mode fail silently. The default value is 0. Full-screen mode is implemented with a number of
# security options already built in, so you might choose to disable it only in specific
# circumstances.
#
FullScreenDisable = 0

# Setting this option to 1 prevents local SWF files from having read access to files on local
# hard drives; that is, local SWF files can’t even run. In addition, remote SWF files are unable
# to upload or download files. The default value is 0. If this value is set to 1, ActionScript
# cannot read any files referenced by a path (including the first SWF file that Flash Player opens)
# on the user’s hard disk. Any ActionScript API that loads files from the local file system is
# blocked. File upload/download via methods of the FileReference and FileReferenceList ActionScript
# APIs are also blocked if this flag is set. In addition, any values set for FileDownloadDisable
# and FileUploadDisable are ignored. It is important to remember that, except for uploading and
# downloading files, the only SWF files that can read local files are SWF files that are themselves
# local. Therefore, you do not need to use this option to prevent remote SWFs from reading local
# data; that is always prevented anyway. If this option is disabled, the ActionScript methods
# FileReference.browse() and FileReferenceList.browse() are also disabled.
#
LocalFileReadDisable = 0

# If this value is set to 1, the ActionScript FileReference.download() method is disabled; the
# user is not prompted to allow a download, and no downloads using the FileReference API are
# allowed. If this value is set to 0 (the default), Flash Player allows the ActionScript
# FileReference.download() method to ask the user where a file can be downloaded to, and then Flash
# Player downloads the file after the user approves the file save location. Files are never
# downloaded without user approval.
#
FileDownloadDisable = 0

# If the FileDownloadDisable value is set to 1, it prevents SWF files from downloading files
# using the FileReference API. The FileDownloadEnabledDomain settings provide exceptions to that
# rule. They create a "white list" of approved domain names or IP addresses from which files can be
# downloaded. If the active security context is in the list of domains and IP addresses then file
# downloads will be allowed. Otherwise it will default to the behavior specified by the
# FileDownloadDisable setting. This value must be set to a string containing a full domain name or
# IP address. The string value must exactly match the domain name or IP address to be enabled.
# Strings with wildcards such as *.adobe.com or 10.1.1.* are not supported. The mms.cfg file can
# contain multiple FileDownloadEnabledDomain settings to allow downloading from multiple domains
# and IP addresses.
#
#FileDownloadEnabledDomain = test.mydomain.com
#FileDownloadEnabledDomain = 10.1.1.10

# If this value is set to 1, all FileReference.upload(), FileReference.browse(), and
# FileReferenceList.browse() activity is disabled; the user is not prompted to upload files, and no
# uploads using the FileReference API are allowed. If this value is set to 0 (the default), Flash
# Player allows files to be uploaded using the FileReference API. The user is prompted to select a
# file to upload and to approve the selection. Files are never uploaded without user approval.
#
FileUploadDisable = 0

# If the FileUploadDisable value is set to 1, it prevents SWF files from uploading files using
# the FileReference API. The FileUploadEnabledDomain settings provide exceptions to that rule. They
# create a "white list" of approved domain names or IP addresses to which files can be uploaded. If
# the active security context is in the list of domains and IP addresses then file uploads will be
# allowed. Otherwise it will default to the behavior specified by the FileUploadDisable setting.
# This value must be set to a string containing a full domain name or IP address. The string value
# must exactly match the domain name or IP address to be enabled. Strings with wildcards such as
# *.adobe.com or 10.1.1.* are not supported. The mms.cfg file can contain multiple
# FileDownloadEnabledDomain settings to allow uploading to multiple domains and IP addresses.
#
#FileDownloadEnabledDomain=test.mydomain.com
#FileDownloadEnabledDomain=10.1.1.10

# This value specifies a hard limit on the amount of local storage that Flash Player uses (per
# domain) for persistent shared objects. The user can use the Settings Manager or Local Storage
# Settings dialog box to specify local storage limits. If no value is set here and the user
# doesn’t specify storage limits, the default limit is 100 KB per domain. If this value is set to
# 6 (the default), the user specifies the storage limits for each domain. If LocalStorageLimit is
# set, the Local Storage tab shows the limit specified, and the user can use this tab as if the
# limit does not exist. If the user sets more restrictive settings than the value set by
# LocalStorageLimit, they are honored (and displayed the next time the Settings dialog box is
# loaded). However, if the user selects settings higher than the limit set by LocalStorageLimit,
# the user’s settings are ignored. The local file storage limit is best obtained from the
# Settings dialog box, because this security setting is just a maximum value, and the user may have
# set a lower limit. The possible values are: 1 = no storage, 2 = 10 KB, 3 = 100 KB, 4 = 1 MB, 5 =
# 10 MB, 6 = user specifies upper limit
#
LocalStorageLimit = 1

# Third party refers to SWF files that are executing within a browser and have an originating
# domain that does not match the URL displayed in the browser window. If this value is set to 1,
# third-party SWF files can read and write locally persistent shared objects. If this value is set
# to 0, third-party SWF files cannot read or write locally persistent shared objects. This setting
# does not have a default value. If it is not included in the mms.cfg file, the Settings Manager or
# Local Storage Settings dialog box lets the user specify whether to permit locally persistent
# shared objects. If the user doesn’t make any changes, the default is to permit shared objects.
#
ThirdPartyStorage = 0

# This value specifies a hard limit, in MB, on the amount of local storage that Flash Player uses
# for the storage of common Flash components. If this option is not included in the mms.cfg file,
# the Settings Manager lets the user specify whether to permit component storage. However, the user
# can’t specify how much local storage space to use. The default limit is 20 MB. Setting this
# value to 0 disables component storage, and any components that have already been downloaded are
# purged the next time Flash Player runs.
#
AssetCacheSize = 0

# If this value is set to 0 (the default), Flash Player lets a user with admin rights enable or
# disable notification updates for all accounts on the machine in the Settings Manager. Standard
# users, meaning users without admin rights, cannot change this setting for all accounts on the
# machine. Standard users can enable or disable notification update for their individual account.
# That is, you cannot use AutoUpdateDisable = 0 to prevent the user from disabling notification
# updates for their individual account. If this value is set to 1, Flash Player disables
# notification updates and the AutoUpdateInterval, DisableProductDownload, and ProductDisabled
# options are ignored. However, you can still use the SilentAutoUpdateEnable and
# SilentAutoUpdateVerboseLogging options because a standard user cannot disable background updates.
#
AutoUpdateDisable = 1

# If this is a negative value (the default), Flash Player uses the notification update interval
# value specified in the Settings Manager. (If users don't make any changes with the Settings
# Manager, the default is every 7 days.) If this value is set to 0, Flash Player checks for an
# update every time it starts. If this is a positive value, the value specifies the minimum number
# of days between update checks.
#
#AutoUpdateInterval = 14

# If this value is set to 0 (the default), Flash Player can install native code applications that
# are digitally signed and delivered by Adobe. Adobe uses this capability to deliver Flash Player
# updates through the developer-initiated Express Install process, and to deliver the Adobe Acrobat
# Connect screen-sharing functionality. If this value is set to 1, these capabilities are disabled.
# However, if you want to enable some but not all product downloads, set this value to 0 (or omit
# it) and then use the ProductDisabled option to specify which product downloads are not permitted.
#
DisableProductDownload = 1

# This option is effective only when DisableProductDownload has a value of 0 or is not present in
# the mms.cfg file; it creates a list of ProductManager applications that users are not permitted
# to install or launch. Unlike most other mms.cfg options, you can use this option as many times as
# is appropriate for your environment.
#
#ProductDisabled = "application name"

# This setting controls whether to allow a SWF file produced for Flash Player 6 and earlier to
# execute an operation that has been restricted in a newer version of Flash Player. Flash Player 6
# made security sandbox distinctions based on superdomains. For example, SWF files from
# www.example.com and store.example.com were placed in the same sandbox. Flash Player 7 and later
# have made security sandbox distinctions based on exact domains, so, for example, a SWF file from
# www.example.com is placed in a different sandbox than a SWF file from store.example.com. The
# exact-domain behavior is more secure, but occasionally users may encounter a set of cooperating
# SWF files that were created when the older superdomain rules were in effect, and require the
# superdomain rules to work correctly. When this occurs, by default, Flash Player shows a dialog
# box asking users whether to allow or deny access between the two domains. Users may configure a
# permanent answer to this question by selecting Never Ask Again in the dialog, or by visiting the
# Settings Manager. The LegacyDomainMatching setting lets you override users' decisions about this
# situation.  This setting does not have a default value. If it is not included in the mms.cfg
# file, the user can determine whether to allow the operation in a global manner (using the
# Settings Manager), or on a case-by-case basis (using an interactive dialog box). The values the
# user can choose among are "Ask," "Allow," and "Deny." The default value is "Ask". If this value
# is set to 1, Flash Player behaves as though the user answers "allow" whenever they make this
# decision. If it is set to 0, Flash Player behaves as though the user answers "deny" whenever they
# make this decision.
#
#LegacyDomainMatching = 0

# This setting controls how Flash Player determines whether to execute certain local SWF files
# that were originally produced for Flash Player 7 and earlier. Flash Player 7 and earlier placed
# all local SWF files in the local-trusted sandbox. Flash Player 8 and later have, by default,
# placed local SWF files in either the local-with-filesystem or local-with-networking sandbox. In
# order for a SWF file to be placed in the local-trusted sandbox in Flash Player 8 or later, that
# SWF file must be designated trusted, using either the Settings Manager or a trust configuration
# file. This latter behavior is more secure, but occasionally users may encounter an older local
# SWF file that was created when the older local-trusted behavior was in effect, and must be inthe
# local-trusted sandbox in order to work correctly. Users are notified of such situations by a
# dialog box, but the dialog is only a failure notification, not a means to trust the SWF file in
# question. Users can restore the functionality of such SWF files on a case-by-case basis by
# designating them trusted in the Settings Manager, but if users encounter a large number of such
# files, they may also elect in the Settings Manager to place all local SWF files published for
# Flash Player 7 or earlier into the local-trusted sandbox. The LocalFileLegacyAction setting lets
# you override users' decisions about this situation. This setting does not have a default value.
# If it is not included in the mms.cfg file, the user can use the Settings Manager to specify
# whether to place all older local SWF files into the local-trusted sandbox. If this value is set
# to 1 (the most permissive setting), Flash Player behaves as though users had elected to place all
# olderlocal SWF files into the local-trusted sandbox. If this value is set to 0 (the most
# restrictive setting), Flash Player behaves as though users had elected never to automatically
# place older local SWF files into the local-trusted sandbox, and also suppresses the failure
# notification dialog.
#
LocalFileLegacyAction = 0

# This setting lets you prevent users from designating any files on local file systems as trusted
# (that is, placing them into the local-trusted sandbox). This setting applies to SWF files
# published for any version of Flash. If this value is set to 1 (the default), Flash Player allows
# the user to specify whether local files can be placed into the local-trusted sandbox, through the
# use of the Settings Manager Global Security Settings panel and user trust files. If this value is
# set to 0, the user cannot place files into the local-trusted sandbox. That is, the Settings
# Manager Global Security Settings panel and user trust files are ignored.
#
AllowUserLocalTrust = 0

# By default, local security is disabled whenever the ActiveX control is running in a non-browser
# host application. In rare cases when this causes a problem, you can use this setting to enforce
# local security rules for the specified application. You can enforce local security for multiple
# applications by entering a separate EnforceLocalSecurityInActiveXHostApp entry for each
# application. The filename string must specify the executable filename only, not the full path to
# the executable; if you specify a full path, the setting is ignored.
#
#EnforceLocalSecurityInActiveXHostApp = "executable filename"

# This option is similar to "EnforceLocalSecurityInActiveXHostApp", but applies to plug-ins as
# well as the ActiveX control, and imposes stricter security controls. When a plug-in or ActiveX
# control is running within an application specified, it will be as though the HTML parameter
# allowNetworking="none" had been specified. That is, no networking or file system access of any
# kind will be permitted, and the SWF running in the Flash Player will run without the ability to
# load any additional media or communicate with any servers. You can enforce local security for
# multiple applications by entering a separate DisableNetworkAndFilesystemInHostApp entry for each
# application. The filename string must specify the executable filename only, not the full path to
# the executable; if you specify a full path, the setting is ignored.
#
#DisableNetworkAndFilesystemInHostApp = "executable filename"

# This option enables or disables the use of the Socket.connect() and XMLSocket.connect()
# methods. If you don’t include this option in the mms.cfg file, or if its value is set to 0,
# socket connections are permitted to any server. If this value is set to 1, no socket connections
# are allowed. However, if you want to disable some but not all socket connections, set this value
# to 1 and then use EnableSocketsTo to specify one or more servers to which socket connections can
# be made.
#
DisableSockets = 1

# This option is effective only when DisableSockets has a value of 1; it creates a whitelist of
# servers to which socket connections are allowed. Unlike most other mms.cfg options, you can use
# this option as many times as is appropriate for your environment. Note that the servers specified
# are target servers, to which socket connections are made; they are not origin servers, from which
# the connecting SWF files are served. The values specified here must exactly match the values
# specified in the ActionScript connect() methods. If you specify an IP address here, but the
# connect() method specifies a host name, the method fails even if that host name resolves to the
# specified IP address. Similarly, if you specify a host name here but the connect() method
# specifies an IP address, the method fails. Using this option does not take the place of a socket
# policy file on the target server. That is, this option has no effect if the specified server does
# not have a socket policy file.
#
#EnableSocketsTo = test.mydomain.com
#EnableSocketsTo = 10.1.1.10

# The GPU compositing feature is gated by the driver version for video cards. If a card and
# driver combination does not match the requirements needed to implement compositing, set
# OverrideGPUValidation to 1 to override validation of the driver requirements. For example, you
# might want GPU compositing enabled during a specific test suite, even if the video driver in the
# test machine doesn’t meet compositing requirements. This setting overrides driver version
# gating but still checks for VRAM requirements. Adobe recommends that you use this setting with
# care. Overriding GPU validation can result in rendering problems or system crashes due to driver
# issues. After completing the tests or programming tasks that require the use of this setting,
# consider setting it back to 0 (or removing it from the mms.cfg file) for normal operations.
#
OverrideGPUValidation = 0

# This option specifies how the NetStream constructor connects to a server when a value is
# specified for peerID, the second parameter passed to the constructor. If RTMFPP2PDisable has a
# value of 0 or is not present in the mms.cfg file, a peer-to-peer (P2P) connection can be used. If
# this value is 1, any value specified for peerID is ignored and P2P connections are disabled;
# NetStream objects can connect only to Flash Media Server.
#
RTMFPP2PDisable = 1

# If this option is present, Flash Player attempts to make RTMFP connections through the
# specified TURN server in addition to normal UDP sockets. TURN Servers are useful for conveying
# RTMFP network traffic through firewalls that otherwise block UDP packets.
#
#RTMFPTURNProxy = URL of TURN proxy server
